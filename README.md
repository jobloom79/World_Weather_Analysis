# World_Weather_Analysis
## Customize Travel Maps and Itenerary
### Overview of Project:
---Filter weather preferences and travel locations from previously retrieved weather data to identify nearby hotels for beta testers. From the list of potential travel destinations the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

### Analysis and Challenges:
#### Deliverable 1 and 2: Retrieve Weather Data and Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
---The first two challenges were relatively simple in that this was a large amount of reuse of code. This gives insight into being able to build a library of code as we progress with projects, in order to quickly retrieve and refactor code to fit specific requirements.
#### Deliverable 3 Create a Travel Itinerary Map
---This proved to be the most challenging due to having to use several python mathmatical functions like 'to_numpy' to convert dataframe columns to arrays and listing those arrays in a way to get retrieve specific latitude and longitude and then concating the spliced info into one new dataframe. Once this was successfuly done being able to see the specific data mapped and an itenary created and shown in the figure below was rewarding

### Summary: 
---This didn't require specific analysis to review, but understanding and learning about extracting data via API calls and being able to manupulate filtered data to customize a search proved to be valuable
